bootstrap-mistakes
==================

Mistakes we all make. Naive initially but blunders they become later.

Bootstrap is for bootstrapping. For developers who would rather devote their time to development than to designing. But any tool is as effective as its owner. In skilled hands even chopsticks can be lethal, very!

You are masters of own universe. Just belive in yourself and learn from your mistakes.

To help, i would just point out a few.

Order will be like this:

1. Input
2. Pretty Print
3. Code Blocks
4. OOPS!
5. Comments
6. Review
7. Final

FINAL: Aishwarya is the winner. :)

Should not take more than 2 hours to learn from 10 code files.

PS: Code is not perfect at any point in time, we just try to make it better.
